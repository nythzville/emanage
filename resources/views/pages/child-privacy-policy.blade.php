					<p>While Race IT provides a personalized experience, we are committed to safeguarding our users' privacy, especially the privacy of our child users. (For the purposes of this policy a child is a person 12 years of age or younger). <br><br>Race IT is compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, otherwise known as COPPA. We have posted our Children's privacy policy to help both children and parents understand how a child's personal information will be treated as they interact with our registration system and tools. This policy may be modified from time to time to better address your concerns or to reflect new changes in online policy, so please check back frequently. <br><br>For more detailed information on COPPA, please visit: <a href="http://www.coppa.org/coppa.htm">http://www.coppa.org/coppa.htm</a> <br><br></p>

					<h5>What kind of personal information is collected and how is it used?</h5>
					<p>Race IT will not collect personal information about you or your child unless you provide it to us or publicly post it voluntarily and knowingly. We respect the privacy of children, and do not collect any more personal information than is necessary to enable them to participate in the activities we offer at our Web site. However, in order to register for leagues and events, you will be asked to provide registration data through an online registration form. The information collected may include you or your child's legal name, address, telephone number, email address, and birth date. <br><br>We will not sell or rent your child's information to third parties at all, ever, under any circumstances. If you or your child has submitted personal information to us and would like to change it or remove it from our records, simply contact us at <a href="mailto:information@RaceIt.com">information@RaceIT.com</a> and we will delete the information. <br><br>We do not share children’s personal information with anyone other than those who fulfill the registrations performed via our web site (e.g., league administrators, race directors). <br><br></p>
