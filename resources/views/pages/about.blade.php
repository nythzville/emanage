					<h2>Where We started</h2>
					<p>In 2004, Race IT began in Richmond, Virginia when the Richmond Sports Backers expressed a need for a customized registration system for their events. USRaceworks, LLC was quickly formed and it didn’t take long for word to spread about how powerful our platform was. Event directors and organizations across the nation began asking to use our services. It became clear that we needed to establish a new brand that best represented our niche capabilities. RaceIT.com was officially launched in 2007. Our name fuses together our premier online registrations solution for all kinds of events, primarily race events, along with our core business competencies. We are an IT company at heart.</p>
					
					<h2>Where We Are Now</h2>
					<p>Today, Race IT boasts one of the most stable and successful systems in the industry. We take pride in being able to deliver our services with the personalized attention that other companies just can’t provide. While still a small business, our capabilities and features are right in line with the offerings from the big event registration providers. Our strategic release of features and enhancements has been positively received in the marketplace. Over 4 million participants in 20,000 events have utilized registration solutions powered by our platform.</p>
